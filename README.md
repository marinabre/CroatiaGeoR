# CroatiaGeoR
An application was modelled and implemented for analysis and visualisation of geographic data using a statistical programming tool. The application uses data collected from the website of the Croatian bureau of statistics and geographical data from osm.wno-edv-service.de. 
It allows observing the same dataset through multiple different graphs, where the data set used can be chosen from the available datasets or uploaded. The application and data processing have been completely done in the programming language R.
