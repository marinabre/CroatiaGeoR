# CroatiaGeoR
Visualization of geographic data processed in the R programming language  Today, there is more and more relevant data available relating to different geographical locations or areas in Croatia. Examples of these data are gross domestic product achieved in certain time periods in different counties, then the data related to the different economic activities, population, education, the environment and other domains. To be able to make better decisions on the basis of available data, or, just to better understand the data, it is important to display the data in a visually appropriate way. On the other hand, today there are programming languages that allow advanced analysis and data processing. Your task is to explore the possibilities of programming language R and generate new package to enable the display of data related to specific areas of Croatia. For some examples of the available data you should propose and demonstrate an adequate and acceptable way of visualization. Proposed solutions should become available over the applications that can be accessed via a web browser.
